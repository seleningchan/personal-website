# Personal Website UI Layer

This is the [UI Layer](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/layers) for my personal website. It contains these UI related Nuxt modules:

- @nuxtjs/color-mode
- @nuxtjs/tailwindcss
- shadcn-nuxt
- nuxt-icon

To preview what this layer provides, you can run the playground by:

```sh
pnpm -w run dev:ui
```
