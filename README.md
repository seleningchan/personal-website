## Vercel Deployment

Feel free to fork this repo and deploy your own version. Note that there should be two projects deployed on Vercel: the **App** project (located in `packages/app` directory) and the **Santiy studio** project (located in `packages/studio`) for content management.

### Environment Variables

1. Set following environment variable to  **both** of your Vercel projects:

```bash
SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID=
```

2. Set the following environment variable to your **App** project, so that Vercel Edge function rewrites requests start with `/studio` to the Sanity studio site you deployed. Note that you should replace the value to your own domin:

```bash
SANITY_STUDIO_SITE_DOMAIN=https://some-sanity-studio.vercel.app
```

3. Optionally, if you want Nuxt project to proxy all Santiy image assets requests, you can set the following environment variable:

```base
NUXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_IMAGE_BASE_URL=https://www.example.com/sanity-image # replace the domain name part to your own
```
