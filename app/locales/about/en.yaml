about:
  desc: I am Ted Xu, a software engineer living in Hangzhou. In my spare time, I enjoy photography, and the primary purpose of setting up this website is to record and display the photos I have taken. As a software engineer who mainly focuses on front-end development, I used the "Dream Stack" to build this site, and I will continue to iterate on this website in the future.
